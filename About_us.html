              <h5>Createev Café</h5>
                <p>was founded by the owners of Createev Gift Shop as a way to expand their brand into something unique.
                  Being coffee lovers themselves, they saw the potential in merging a coffee shop with a jewelry and gift store, offering
                  customers a one-of-a-kind experience. The name "Createev" combines the word "creative" with the owners' last name,
                  "Tee," reflecting both their artistic nature and passion for handmade bracelets. When asked to describe the café, the
                  owners emphasized three key values: cleanliness, service, and quality. The baristas and staff are trained to be warm and
                  hospitable while ensuring every cup of coffee is made with precision—if a mistake is made, the drink is remade to maintain
                  their high standards. Among their bestsellers are Biscoff coffee and various iced coffee options, which are especially popular
                  in hot weather. To reward loyal customers, the café offers a loyalty card program where every nine coffee purchases earn a free
                  drink. They also provide discounts for senior citizens and persons with disabilities. Createev Café is designed to be a
                  peaceful, hidden gem where customers can relax and unwind. It is a pet-friendly space, embracing the philosophy that
                  "everyone here is welcome." With free Wi-Fi, it has also become a go-to spot for students looking for a quiet place to study.
                  The café's pastel color scheme, featuring shades of green, brown, and beige, enhances its cozy and inviting atmosphere. For
                  added convenience, customers can order online through Grab.</p>
